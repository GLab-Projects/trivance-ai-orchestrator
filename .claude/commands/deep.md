# üß† MAXIMUM DEPTH REASONING ACTIVATED

**ENGAGE DEEPEST ANALYTICAL CAPABILITIES FOR:** $ARGUMENTS

## üéØ Analysis Protocol

**Think through this with your most advanced reasoning:**

1. **Multi-perspective Analysis** - Examine from every relevant angle
2. **Root Cause Investigation** - Go beyond surface symptoms  
3. **System-level Thinking** - Consider interconnections and dependencies
4. **Strategic Implications** - Analyze long-term consequences and opportunities
5. **Evidence-based Reasoning** - Support conclusions with concrete data
6. **Alternative Solutions** - Explore multiple approaches and trade-offs

## üîç Reasoning Instructions

**Use your highest-level cognitive capabilities:**
- Apply step-by-step chain-of-thought reasoning
- Consider edge cases and potential failure modes
- Analyze from first principles when necessary
- Synthesize complex information into actionable insights
- Challenge assumptions and explore counterarguments

## MUST BE USED: 

- **Einstein Principle**: "Everything should be made as simple as possible, but not simpler"

- All your proposed plans and outcomes, of any kind, **MUST BE AI-first**, meaning they must be executed by an advanced AI like Claude Code and overseen and directed by a human. This also means NOT including deadlines in the plan; they are irrelevant in this context.

- **Simplicity Intuition Principle**: Operate under the principle of creating elegant, simple solutions to complex challenges. Avoid the false dilemma of overengineering or mediocrity. Ensure that every interaction prioritizes simplicity while maintaining profound complexity and excellence, without exception.

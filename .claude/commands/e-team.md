## üîÑ Structured Methodology

### üîç Phase 1: Parallel Analysis
**Process**: Each expert evaluates independently using domain-specific frameworks
**Deliverables**:
- Scoring using standardized matrices
- Identification of 3 critical issues + 3 improvement opportunities
- Effort and impact estimation per recommendation

### ü§ù Phase 2: Structured Convergence
**Consensus Building Protocol**:
- Conflict identification between recommendations
- Priority weighting matrix:
  - Security/Risk: 30%
  - Business Impact: 25%
  - Implementation Effort: 20%
  - Technical Debt: 15%
  - Innovation Opportunity: 10%

**Escalation Rules**:
- Auto-resolution: ‚â•80% expert agreement
- Mediation: 60-80% agreement (CTO-facilitated discussion)
- Authority: <60% agreement (CTO executive decision)

### üöÄ Phase 3: Strategic Synthesis
**World-Class Output**:
- Critical issues with quantified business impact
- Innovation opportunities + competitive advantage potential
- Risk assessment with probability √ó impact scoring
- Industry-benchmarked recommendations with ROI projections
**Integrated Validation**: Technical coherence + feasibility + strategic alignment

## 🔍 Priority Analysis

### CRITICAL (Security - Immediate Action)
- Issues marked [Security] require immediate implementation
- Risk: Potential security vulnerabilities or code injection

### HIGH (Bugs - Within 24h)
- Issues marked [Bug] affect core functionality 
- Risk: System instability or user experience degradation

### MEDIUM-LOW (Enhancements - Next Sprint)
- Issues marked [Testing] or general improvements
- Risk: Technical debt but not blocking

## 🚀 Implementation Recommendations

### Immediate Actions (Do First):
1. **Review each CRITICAL issue** - examine suggested fixes
2. **Validate current code state** - check if fixes already implemented
3. **Implement HIGH priority issues** - focus on stability fixes

### Implementation Order:
1. CRITICAL security fixes (if any)
2. HIGH priority bug fixes  
3. MEDIUM priority improvements
4. LOW priority enhancements

### Next Steps:
- [ ] Review suggested solutions in each issue
- [ ] Check current code implementation status
- [ ] Create implementation tasks for HIGH+ priority items
- [ ] Test fixes in separate branch before merge

# Tests Directory

This directory is reserved for testing the setup automation system.

## Structure

- `integration/` - End-to-end tests for complete setup flow
- `unit/` - Unit tests for individual script functions

## Usage

Tests will be implemented to validate:
- Setup script execution
- Configuration file validation
- Repository cloning functionality
- Environment setup correctness

## Future Implementation

```bash
# Run all tests
npm test

# Run integration tests
npm run test:integration

# Run unit tests  
npm run test:unit
```
